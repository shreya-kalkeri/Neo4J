User Story  : Categorizing and monitoring the customer behaviour
1. CATEGORIZE THE CUSTOMER  
  Analyse the customer behaviour     
  A manager can categorise a customer as a valuable member or a regular member based on customer's total order amount  
  So that priority services can be provided to the Valuable customers like extra discounts and an early access to sales   
  e.g., Amazon gives 24-hour early access to its sales for the users with PRIME subscriptions  

2. MONITORING WEBSITE VISITS
  Monitor the customer activity   
  A manager can keep a close check on how many times a particular customer views their shopping website  
  So that we can suggest products to that customer more efficiently based on their purchase history   
  e.g., If I had recently checked Amazon.de, then even in other web pages I get advertisement from Amazon.de with my recently searched products
